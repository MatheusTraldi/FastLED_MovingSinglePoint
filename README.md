# FastLED_MovingSinglePoint
A simple aplication of the FastLED library using the Arduino IDE

Instal the library at https://github.com/FastLED/FastLED

This aplication uses a strip of 144 WS2812B LEDs

The program was created thinking in ESP32 as the development board. That's why PIN 2 was chosen as data pin, once it is also the internal LED pin.
